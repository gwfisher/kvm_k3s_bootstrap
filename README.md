Oh Hai! :D

You found my terraform k3s bootstrap thingy.

This is actually a demo for a company I hope to work for *cough* amazee.io *cough*

This uses:
* Terraform - because vagrant is kinda sucky
* k3s - I just discovered this. I was using minikube, but k3s is so much more fun and flexible
* bash - cuz everyone loves bash, and ansible is overkill for provisioning.
* libvirt - I love KVWM for private cloud work. Otherwise it's AWS. Because let's face it, Google is crap.

I like K.I.S.S (keep it simple smartass)

This is also a useful example of the libvirt-terraform provider also
